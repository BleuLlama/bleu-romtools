0.94	First released version

0.95	Converted 0crt.asm to Z80 opcodes.  Changed some JPs to JRs.
	Removed i8085 files from distribution, available separately.
	Tried compiling with lcc, found a couple of bugs:
		Made ctype[] unsigned char to get 8 bits.
		Unary - of unsigned int seems harmless, but keep in mind.
		lcc doesn't like liberties taken in scc code at all.
	Got modified cpp from Michael Haardt which does ANSI stringification.
	Made scc ignore plain # (same as #line) directives.
	Changed hello.c to take advantage of stringification.
	Updated README for new resources.

0.96	Added ANSI C concatenation of adjacent strings.
	Changed hello.c to take advantage of this.
	Moved lib and include to first level.
	Added pseudojumps to assembler. These assemble to JR whenever
	possible, but JP in worst case. Use with caution.
	Modified compiler to take advantage of this.
	Fixed bug that allowed jr m,dest which is not a legal opcode.
	Added a peephole optimiser: Chris Fraser's copt
	Modified compiler to generate extra information needed by pho
	Added -O flag to zcc to enable optimiser
