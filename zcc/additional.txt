.bound ADDRESS

	define a top boundary for a chunk of code.  If the assembler
	puts a byte on the address defined, a warning will be generated.
	This is helpful when making rom patches, when you have a very 
	limited, specific romspace to fit your code into.

	example:


.org	0x4300
foo:
	ld a, ix
	inc a
	jp bar
.bound	0x4380

.org	0x4400
bar:
	inc a
	add b
	ld (hl), a
	ret
.bound	0x4420


.repeat BYTE, COUNT

	repeats "BYTE" for "COUNT" times.  If COUNT is 0, then no work
	is done, otherwise, the byte will be repeated.

	example:

		.repeat 0x42, 7
		; equivalent to
		.byte 0x42, 0x42, 0x42, 0x42, 0x42, 0x42, 0x42


.fill BYTE, ADDRESS

	Will repeat BYTE until the current position is ADDRESS.
	This is inclusive, so ADDRESS will contain BYTE as well.
	NOTE: there is a small bug where negative indexing the
	address near 0x0000 causes a hang.

	example:

		.org 0x1000
		.fill   0x99, 0x11ff	; fills to 1ff with 0x99

		.org 0x0000
		.fill	0x00, .-1	; DO NOT DO THIS
