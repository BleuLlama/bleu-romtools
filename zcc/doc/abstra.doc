        Abstract:  

           The  ASxxxx  assemblers are a series of microprocessor assem-
        blers written in the C programming  language.   This  collection
        contains cross assemblers for the 6800(6802/6808), 6801(hd6303),
        6804, 6805, 6809, 6811, 8085(8080), and  z80(hd64180)  micropro-
        cessors.   Each  assembler  has  a device specific section which
        includes:  (1) device description, byte order, and  file  exten-
        sion  information,  (2) a table of assembler general directives,
        special directives, assembler mnemonics and associated operation
        codes,  (3)  machine  specific  code  for  processing the device
        mnemonics, addressing modes, and special directives.  

           The assemblers have a common device independent section which
        handles the details of file input/output, symbol  table  genera-
        tion,  program/data  areas,  expression  analysis, and assembler
        directive processing.  

           The  assemblers  provide  the following features:  (1) alpha-
        betized, formatted symbol table listings, (2) relocatable object
        modules, (3) global symbols for linking object modules, (4) con-
        ditional assembly directives, (5) reusable  local  symbols,  and
        (6) include-file processing.  

           The  companion program ASLINK is a relocating linker perform-
        ing the following functions:  (1) bind multiple  object  modules
        into  a  single  memory  image,  (2) resolve inter-module symbol
        references, (3) process absolute,  relative,  concatenated,  and
        overlay  attributes  in  data  and program sections, (4) perform
        byte and word program-counter relative (pc  or  pcr)  addressing
        calculations,  (5)  define  absolute symbol values at link time,
        (6) define absolute area base address values at link  time,  (7)
        produce Intel Hex or Motorola S19 output file, and (8) produce a
        map of the linked memory image.  

           The  assemblers  and  linker  have  been tested using DECUS C
        under TSX+ and RT-11, PDOS C V5.4b, and with TurboC  V1.5  under
        MS/DOS.   Complete  source code and documentation for the assem-
        blers and linker  is  included  with  the  distribution.   Addi-
        tionally,   test   code   for   each   assembler   and   several
        microprocessor monitors ( ASSIST05  for  the  6805,  MONDEB  and
        ASSIST09  for  the  6809,  and BUFFALO 2.5 for the 6811) are in-
        cluded as working examples of use of these assemblers.
