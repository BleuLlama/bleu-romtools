           The  ASxxxx  assembler  and  linker have been updated to move
        byte index, direct page  mode,  and  byte  pc  relative  address
        checking  from the assembler to the linker.  This change has al-
        lowed the following enhancements:  

             1.  The  .setdp  directive  now has a common format for all
                 AS68xx assemblers.  

             2.  Direct  page  variables  may be externally defined with
                 their addresses resolved at link time.  

             3.  Byte  index  offsets  may  be  external  references and
                 resolved at link time.  

             4.  Byte  pc  relative  instructions  (i.e.   branches) may
                 reference external labels or labels in other areas.  


           The  ASxxxx  assemblers  (using  the  -f  or  -ff option) can
        generate a listing file which flags the data that will be  relo-
        cated by the linker.  

           The  REL file format now has an additional directive for pag-
        ing information and has additional flags for  page0,  page,  and
        unsigned  byte  formats.   The new linker is compatible with the
        first version of the ASxxxx assemblers.  

           The  remaining changes are related to non-portable code found
        while porting the assemblers to a motorola 68030 system.
