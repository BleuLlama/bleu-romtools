Michael Bolton is trying to take over the Moon. In order for him
to do this, he has been stealing bunnies, alligators and oragutans
from all of the zoos across North America and implanting them with
mind control chips.

In order for him to gain control of the Moon, he must get all of
these animals to pray to the Moon simultaneously.

He has scatterd these animals on islands in lakes throughout North
America. Their mind control chips will make them go insane if they're
not removed before the next full moon.

This is, of course, absurd.

Your mission is to retrieve the mind control crystals from all of
the islands, and return the animals to their homes before the next
full moon, so that the explosive implants can be removed safely.

He has sent a few Staple Dragons to protect the crystals.

This is also, of course, absurd.

Oh, and if you push around the animals too much, they explode.  Go figure.

You have 25 days. Save the animals.
