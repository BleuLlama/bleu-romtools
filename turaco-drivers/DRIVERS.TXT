    0 bitplane games have no graphics (vector games) and were deleted
    5 bitplane games have more colors than the palette supports
    8 bitplane games have more colors than the palette supports

    After intgeration with the old drivers, we get 850 drivers
    (Almost 4 times as many as before!!)

    Missing driver categories:
        ASTRCADE, BERZERK, GAMEPLAN, M8080, MISSILE, MZ80, QIX, STRATOVOX
        WILLIAMS
        some of these are bitmap-based graphics, not sprite-based graphics
        like the M8080 and williams games.  Others are vector games.
        (look in TXT\DRIVERS.BAT for which games these are)
