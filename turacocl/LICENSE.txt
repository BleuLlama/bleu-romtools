    There is one source module in this distribution which uses external
    code.  The file "ini/fronthlp.c" is based on the xMAME 0.65.1
    source code.  This modified xMAME source code is available upon
    request, although the only difference is the above source module.

    From the MAME License:

	   This chapter might not apply to specific portions of
	   MAME (e.g. CPU emulators) which bear different copyright
	   notices.  The source code cannot be used in a commercial
	   product without the written authorization of the
	   authors. Use in non-commercial products is allowed, and
	   indeed encouraged.  If you use portions of the MAME
	   source code in your program, however, you must make the
	   full source code freely available as well.
